# The Problem

Each and every functionality that we build in our system is tracked as an *Issue* in our Issue Management System.

Almost always it starts with a one liner description, however as we go deeper in to it, it turns out to be much larger than appears in the first look.

Given the costs involved it is a challange to be able to estimate the requirements, so that we can have a sense of the size and work out the costs and assess ROI as close as possible

As we have a decent sized database to examine the past issues in terms of their size and expansion into sub items, we believe it is possible to extract meaningful information from our data repository

To start with we are experimenting with following indicators

## Indicators
### Number of Final Items
This is the count of items which does not have any child items. Idea is that these are the only items which were actually worked upon

### Number of items with 1 level depth
### Number of items with 2 level depth
### Number of items with 3 level depth
### Number of items with 4 level depth
### Number of items with 5 level depth

## How are these indicators going to be used
*TODO* - This is a critical step, ideally no work should be done unless we have clarity on how these indicators will be used, What it means is what is the hypothesis that we want to validate. Just to elaborate, which trend in these indicators will expose what insights, as without any predefined strategy, we will end up artificially try to make these indicators look like valuable
